# Discrepancies

* On the search companies section, it says 'View stories and data from an ASX listed company' but it actually allows you to search for companies that are not ASX listed as well. (Tried with 'google' and 'facebook')
* When searching for companies in search bar, it usually returns the company name and company stock symbol in the result, not limited to ASX listed companies (was able to check this via searching for 'Facebook'). When searching for 'Google' though it did not return the stock symbol for Google.
* If a non ASX company one of the 6 company entries for the day, it does not display the stock prices and stock price movement.
